<h1>Auto Lotto<img align="right" src="./Data/images/main.png" width="100px"></h1>

Content library that allows users to automate lottery systems in Avrae. This lottery system allows server administrators to create a lottery system that can be used to reward players with items, gold, or other rewards. The system is designed to be flexible and easy to use, allowing for customization of the rewards and the chance of winning them. This lottery system also supports the use of inline rolling to allow further customization of the rewards.
